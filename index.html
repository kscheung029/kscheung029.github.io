						<h2>Introduction to Japan</h2>
						<p>Japan, officially Nippon (日本) is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific
							Ocean, it lies to the east of China, Korea and Russia. The characters that make up Japan's
							name mean "sun-origin", which is why Japan is sometimes identified as the "Land of the
							Rising Sun".
							<br><br>
							Japan comprises over 3,000 islands, the largest of which are Honshū, Hokkaidō, Kyūshū and
							Shikoku. Most of the islands are mountainous, many volcanic; for example, Japan’s highest
							peak, Mount Fuji, is a volcano. Japan has the world's tenth largest population, with about
							128 million people. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes the capital city of Tokyo and
							several surrounding prefectures, is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with over 30
							million residents.
							<br><br>
							Influence from the outside world followed by long periods of isolation has characterized
							Japan's history. Since adopting its constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary
							constitutional monarchy with an emperor and an elected parliament, the Diet.
							<br><br>
							A major economic power, Japan has the world's third largest economy by nominal GDP. It is a
							member of the United Nations, G8, G4, OECD and APEC, with the world's fifth largest defense
							budget. It is also the world's fourth largest exporter and sixth largest importer and a
							world leader in technology and machinery.</p>
