# Hi everyone!
This is My BCIT SSD Program's Web passion project, which is a demo boosting website for one of the most played game named League of Legend. <br><br>
Currently it is just a for-fun website to entertain me and my friends online so nothing serious is going on, but I will consider to make it an actual running website in the future.<br><br>
Website is built mainly with HTMLCSS and Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a responsive, mobile-first front-end web development language.<br><br>
The website let customers look through a list of coaches/players and inquiry one of the service of their desire.<br><br>
After that, they will allow to send custom message to the website for any additional inquiry.<br><br>
At the end, they are redirect to paypal website to pay with either credit card or paypal balance within the paypal system.
