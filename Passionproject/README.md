# Hi everyone!
This is My BCIT SSD Program's Web passion project, which is a demo boosting website for one of the most played game named League of Legend. <br><br>
Video guide:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MaoQxffqOo&feature=youtu.be<br><br>
Currently it is just a for-fun website to entertain me and my friends online so nothing serious is going on, but I will consider to make it an actual running website in the future.<br><br>
There is 2-3 features that will be added in the future due to time constraint of the project, but you get the idea of what features are going to be added.<br><br>
Website is built mainly with HTMLCSS and Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a responsive, mobile-first front-end web development language.<br><br>
The website let customers look through a list of coaches/players and inquiry one of the service of their desire.<br><br>
After that, they will allow to send custom message to the website for any additional inquiry.<br><br>
At the end, they are redirect to paypal website to pay with either credit card or paypal balance within the paypal system.<br><br>
All the progress details are in the issue page, and all the issue is closed for finalizing the project. More issue will be created once this project is WIP  at future again.
