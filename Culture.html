                        <p>Japanese is the official and primary language of Japan. Japanese has a lexically distinct
                            pitch-accent system. Early Japanese is known largely on the basis of its state in the 8th
                            century, when the three major works of Old Japanese were compiled. The earliest attestation
                            of
                            the Japanese language is in a Chinese document from 252 AD.

                            Japanese is written with a combination of three scripts: hiragana, derived from the Chinese
                            cursive script, katakana, derived as a shorthand from Chinese characters, and kanji,
                            imported
                            from China.</p>

                        <p>Through a long culinary past, the Japanese have developed sophisticated and refined cuisine.
                            In
                            more recent years, Japanese food has become fashionable and popular in the United States,
                            Europe, and many other areas. Dishes such as sushi, tempura, noodles, and teriyaki are some
                            of
                            the foods that are commonly known. The Japanese diet consists principally of rice; fresh,
                            lean
                            seafood; and pickled or boiled vegetables. The healthy Japanese diet is often believed to be
                            related to the longevity of Japanese people. </p>
